# Modules & Packages functionality

Adding MainPackage & SubPackage as examples to demostrate how Packages can be used

## Steps to work

module_example.py is the starting point. Go to terminal, change directory to the folder when it resides.
Run the code "python module_example.py"

### OR

Open the module_example.py in an IDE & run. Below is the expected output

This is inside MainPackage in my_main_script.py
This is inside SubPackage in my_sub_script.py

## Point to remember
1. __init__.py is essential for the packages to work
2. "module_example.py" needs to be executed in CLI to see how MainPackage & SubPackage work
