# Advanced Modules Exercise Puzzle

It's time to test your new skills, this puzzle project will combine multiple skills sets, including unzipping files with Python, using os module to automatically search through lots of files.

## Your Goal

This is a puzzle, so we don't want to give you too much guidance and instead have you figure out things on your own.

There is a .zip file called 'unzip_me_for_instructions.zip', unzip it, open the .txt file with Python, read the instructions and see if you can figure out what you need to do!
